# [Piggy Bank project developed for my BSc. Software Engineering]

This is my second solution for my uni's assignment, where we had to develop a piggy bank using Java, using an abstract class, concepts of polymorph and inheritance.
* On this solution, I used the value input will sum up to the 3 currencies possible - euro, dolar or real.
    * To add a currency, you can put any value you think it's right, it will sum up with the other coins.
    * To remove a currency you can put any amount you think it's right, it will deduct from the righ currency. Unless you try to remove more than what you own, then it won't work.
    * When you list the coins, you will be able to see all currencies added and at the end of the list, you will get the total of the amount.
    * As part of the assignment, we also had to display all the coins converted to reais (BRL - brazilial Real currency);
